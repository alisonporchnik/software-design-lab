##Lisa's Course Goals

Goal One
Become familiar enough with Python and command line to be able to use them on my own for tasks and projects

Benchmark: Use Python on my own without tears, use command line to figure things out or solve problems.

Goal Two
Achieve semi-fluency in HTML/CSS. (What I have now is varying levels of "familiarity" with which I bumble around on the back end of sites and waste a lot of time.)

Benchmark:  Design and create a web page (hosted by Github or locally) without using a template

Goal Three
Learn enough about Java and/or JavaScript to understand how it works and when it's useful.

Benchmark: write a super simple app that uses JS
