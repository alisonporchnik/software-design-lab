##Lisa's Course Goals

## Goal One

Become familiar enough with Python and command line to be able to use them on my own for tasks and projects
-----

Benchmark: Use Python on my own without tears, use command line to figure things out or solve problems.


## Goal Two 
Achieve semi-fluency in HTML/CSS. (What I have now is varying levels of "familiarity" with which I bumble around on the back end of sites and waste a lot of time.)

-----

Benchmark: Customize a Wordpress theme - or the equivalent - beyond changing fonts and colors

## Goal Three 
Learn enough about Java and/or JavaScript to create an app for interactive visualizations either in a browser or offline

-----

Benchmark: Know enough to be able to begin building my DH capstone project or realize that the language/script will be useless and I can do it all in Python. (See Goal One.)
